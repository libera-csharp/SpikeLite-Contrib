SpikeLite-Contrib
=================

The SpikeLite-Contrib repo contains various odds and ends that are related to the main Freenode-Csharp/SpikeLite repository. These may be modules, web views, tools or fan fiction. Well, probably not fan fiction... Please note that individual modules may have additional READMEs.

The current modules are:

* WebHookSupport - provides something that parses GitHub Webhook posts and converts them into something that resembles CIA.vc notices, using the bot's WCF-based IPC.
